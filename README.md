# Synchronoss Parser

Utility scripts for working with Synchronoss data exports.

This toolbox converts Verizon/Synchronoss backups into more useful formats. It can compile media
files, convert contact lists, merge call logs with contacts, render HTML message transcripts and
produce attachment inventories. A Tkinter GUI exposes these features for nonâ€‘technical users.

Phone numbers are normalized by removing punctuation and an optional leading `1` country code so
contacts match regardless of formatting.

## Sample data layout

Scripts expect exports arranged like:

```
Call Log/
  call_log.csv
messages/
  <date>.csv
  attachments/
    mms/in/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<files>
    mms/out/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<files>
```

## Installation

Install the package and its dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

Tkinter may require additional OS-level packages.

## Scripts

### collect_media.py
Copy media from a Verizon Mobile backup into a single folder and log EXIF metadata to Excel.

```bash
collect-media
```

### collect_attachments.py
Collect message attachments from a Synchronoss export into a single folder and log metadata to
Excel.

The script scans the `messages/attachments/` directory:

```
messages/
  attachments/
    mms/in/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<files>
    mms/out/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<files>
```

All files are copied to `Compiled Attachments/` and their details recorded in
`Compiled Attachments/compiled_attachment_log/compiled_attachment_log.xlsx`.

```bash
collect-attachments
```

### contacts_to_excel.py
Convert a `contacts.txt` export to an Excel spreadsheet.

```bash
contacts-to-excel --input contacts.txt --output contacts.xlsx
```

### merge_contacts_logs.py
Annotate a call log CSV with caller and recipient names using a contacts Excel file.

```bash
merge-contacts-logs --call-log "Call Log/call_log.csv" --contacts-xlsx contacts.xlsx
```

### render_transcripts.py
Render chat-bubble style HTML transcripts from message CSVs and link attachments. Optionally supply
a contacts Excel file for name lookups.

```bash
render-transcripts --in messages --out transcripts --contacts-xlsx contacts.xlsx
```

### toolbox_gui.py
Tkinter GUI that wraps Collect Media, Collect Attachments, Contacts to Excel and Render Transcripts workflows.

```bash
toolbox-gui
```

### collect_media_gui.py
Simple GUI wrapper for `collect_media.py`.

```bash
collect-media-gui
```
 
## Building Windows Executables

Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Build one-file, windowed executables for the GUI scripts using the provided
helper after installing the package:

```bash
build-exe
```

The command invokes PyInstaller on `toolbox_gui.spec` (and
`collect_media_gui.spec` if present). PyInstaller places the resulting
executables in `dist/` and bundles Python and all required libraries, so
recipients don't need Python installed. On Windows, run them by
double-clicking or from a Command Prompt:

```bash
dist\\toolbox_gui.exe
dist\\collect_media_gui.exe
```

### Verifying the build

Run the generated `.exe` on a clean Windows machine without Python
installed to confirm the bundled interpreter works. Copy the file from
`dist/` to the test system and launch it; the application should open
normally without additional dependencies.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```
